          research and lessen wear on documents, and are made solely for the personal use of
          the individual researcher requesting them. Printed copies of downloaded documents
          and any reproduction of the same may not be transferred to another individual or organization,
          deposited at another institution, or reduplicated without prior permission of the
          Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center.
        </p>
        <h2>Photoduplication</h2><a name="photoduplication"></a><p>In some cases, SCARC may refuse to make copies because of the physical condition of
          the material, the amount of staff time required to do the work, special restrictions
          imposed by the donor, copyright law, or right-to-privacy statutes, or for any other
          reason. All photocopying is done by the SCARC staff.
        </p>
        <p>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the
          making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain
          conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives were authorized to furnish
          a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy
          or other reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study,
          scholarship or research." If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy
          or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for
          copyright infringement.
        </p>
        <p>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its
          judgement, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
