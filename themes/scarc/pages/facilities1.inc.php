        The <a href="coll/strain/index.html">Douglas Strain</a> Reading Room in the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center houses the <a href="coll/science/index.html">History of Science</a> book collection. The reading area offers a pleasant environment for researchers and
        visiting scholars. The spacious floor is made of giant timber bamboo from Central
        Northern China and the furniture is of white maple.

        <h2>Linus Pauling's Office</h2><a name="linus-pauling's-office"></a><p>Viewable from the Strain Reading Room is an area containing items from Linus Pauling's
          office at the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, including his desk
          and chalkboard. Hanging on the walls are other items including a panoramic image of
          Pauling's Caltech office, a portrait of Ava Helen Pauling, and a special keepsake
          from the United States Postal Service marking the release of the Pauling postage stamp
          in March 2008.

It involved this
                           unusual compound. Benzine has a six-membered ring of carbon atoms and this compound
                           has three six-membered rings consisting of six carbon atoms and seven nitrogen atoms
                           and then it has these hydroxyl groups attached. It is known that the similar substance
                           with only one ring can be made into certain derivatives that have anti-cancer activity.
                           And I thought that this substance with only three rings might well operate in the
                           same way and that we should study it."</span></div><br style="clear: both;" /></p>
