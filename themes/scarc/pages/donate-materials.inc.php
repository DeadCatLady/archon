        <h2>Donating Materials to the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center</h2><a name="donating-materials-to-the-special-collections-&amp;-archives-research-center"></a><p>The Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center (SCARC) accepts additions to its
          collections and holdings, especially unpublished personal papers and organizational
          records such as correspondence, diaries, photographs, scrapbooks, and research files
          that complement records created by Oregon State University.
        </p>
        <p>When materials are transferred, donors and SCARC staff both complete an "Instrument
          of Donation" form, which transfers legal custody of the materials to SCARC and also
          prescribes donation conditions and (if any) restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>General information on donating materials is available online in the form of two brochures
          published by the Society of American Archivists, "<a href="http://www.archivists.org/publications/donating-familyrecs.asp">Donating Your Personal or Family Papers to a Repository</a>" and "<a href="http://www.archivists.org/publications/donating-orgrecs.asp">Donating Your Organizational Records to a Repository</a>".
        </p>
        <p>For additional information on donating materials or making a monetary contribution
          to SCARC, please contact us at 541-737-2075 or <a href="mailto:scarc@oregonstate.edu">scarc@oregonstate.edu</a></p>
        <h2>Donation Guidelines and Policies</h2><a name="donation-guidelines-and-policies"></a><p>Oregon Administrative Rules, Chapter 166, stipulates that archives of the institutions
          of the Oregon State System of Higher Education may "add records of private origin
          which relate to the history of the institution, its faculty and students, or to academic
          or research interests of their communities."
        </p>
        <p>Collections and manuscripts are selected for preservation in the Special Collections
          &amp; Archives Research Center primarily because of their historical research value. Materials
          accessioned will generally document the history of Oregon State University, its community,
          and activities, or will fit within SCARC's broader collection development guidelines.
          Historical collections and manuscripts accessioned by SCARC may include memorabilia,
          records, printed documents, photographic images, maps, graphic materials, books and
          other historically significant materials in other physical forms. The historical resources
          of the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center are available for public use
          on the premises during regular business hours, unless otherwise specified in the donor
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>Unless otherwise restricted by copyright or by the donor and agreed to by SCARC at
          the time of acquisition, all literary rights are conveyed to the Special Collections
          &amp; Archives Research Center. All donor access and use restrictions and conditions will
          be specified in the donation agreement. SCARC can assume no responsibility for abuse
          of literary or copyright restrictions by users of research materials.
        </p>
        <p>Gifts to the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center are considered outright
          donations to be used in the best interest of SCARC. Donations become the sole and
          irrevocable property of the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center.
        </p>
        <p>Usually, accepted gifts are considered extremely important or the best historical
          resources available at the time acquired. However, no individual or institution can
          predict or govern the changing attitudes of future generations, nor guarantee permanency
          beyond the best available preservation procedures. SCARC reserves the right to reevaluate
          and reappraise historical material in its holdings and to deaccesion them when appropriate.
          Deaccessioned collections and items weeded from collections during processing, due
          to duplication, irrelevance, limited use, or deterioration, will be offered to the
          original donor or their agent if so requested at the time of donation. If the donor
          wishes not to reclaim the material or can not be located, SCARC reserves the right
          to offer the material to other depositories or discard the items. Any material declared
          expendable must be approved by the Director of SCARC.
        </p>
        <p>Donations of historical material to a public research facility may be tax deductible.
          However, the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center can not appraise donations
          for tax purposes. For the protection of the donor, it is recommended that such appraisals
          be done by a disinterested third party and before title to the material is conveyed
          to the Special Collections &amp; Archives Research Center.
